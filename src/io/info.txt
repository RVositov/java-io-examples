Thre are two based on bytes (binary) streams:
 1) InputStream;
 2) OutputStream.
Thre are two based on characters (text):
 1) Reader;
 2) Writer.

I/O Streams:
 - Byte Streams handle I/O of raw binary data.
 - Character Streams handle I/O of character data, automatically handling translation to and from the local character set.
 - Buffered Streams optimize input and output by reducing the number of calls to the native API.
 - Scanning and Formatting allows a program to read and write formatted text.
 - I/O from the Command Line describes the Standard Streams and the Console object.
 - Data Streams handle binary I/O of primitive data type and String values.
 - Object Streams handle binary I/O of objects.

 
Buffered in/out or reader/writer used bytes/chars from memory.
